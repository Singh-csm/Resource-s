DOM:
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents. In other words, it represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. With the DOM, programmers can access and manipulate the content of a web page.

Pass by value and Pass by reference:
Pass by value and pass by reference are two methods of passing data between functions or variables. In pass by value, a copy of the data is created and passed to the function or variable, whereas in pass by reference, a reference to the original data is passed. In JavaScript, primitive types such as numbers and strings are passed by value, whereas objects and arrays are passed by reference.

Promises:
Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous operations than using callbacks.

Closures:
A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are used in JavaScript to create private variables and functions, as well as to implement callbacks and other advanced programming techniques.

SYNC and ASYNC:
SYNC and ASYNC refer to synchronous and asynchronous programming. In synchronous programming, each operation is executed one after another, and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one. In asynchronous programming, operations can be executed simultaneously, and the program does not have to wait for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.

Components:
Components are a fundamental building block of modern front-end web development frameworks like React. A component is a modular, reusable piece of code that encapsulates a specific piece of functionality or UI element.

useState:
useState is a React hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. State allows you to store and update data within a component, and can be used to create dynamic UIs.

Event loop:
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for asynchronous programming. It is responsible for handling callbacks and ensuring that the program executes all of its code in the correct order.

Callback:
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called when a specific event occurs or a specific condition is met. Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous programming.

RESTful API:
A RESTful API is a type of web API that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). RESTful APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manipulate resources on a server.

Middleware:
Middleware is software that sits between two applications or systems, allowing them to communicate with each other. In the context of web development, middleware is often used to handle common tasks like authentication, logging, and request parsing.

Error Handling:
Error handling is the process of dealing with errors that occur in a program. In JavaScript, errors can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks, which allow you to gracefully handle errors without crashing the entire program.

Reference and Populate:
Reference and populate are terms used in MongoDB to describe the relationship between documents in different collections. Referencing allows you to store references to other documents in a collection, while populating allows you to retrieve those referenced documents.

Replica Set:
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are used to ensure that data is always available, even in the event of server failures.

Transaction Property in DBMS:
Transaction is a property of database management systems that ensures the consistency, integrity, and durability of data during database operations. A transaction is a set of operations that must either all succeed or all fail,
